With around 77% of the global workforce working from home full-time according to a report by Global Workplace Analytics, 
2020 saw an explosion of google searches for “Zoom Fatigue”.


Now that the end of the pandemic is in sight, there has been much speculation on what the future of work will look like. 
Using worldwide patent application data for “work-from-home” (WFH) related technologies as a proxy for measuring innovation (PATENTSCOPE database), 
we observe that innovation in this space was on the rise prior to the pandemic but seems to have slowed down considerably towards the end of 2020, 
perhaps suggesting that - with much of the needed technology already present - the break-through leading to successful WFH outcomes was 
not so much technological as it was organizational and cultural. And now that the organizational and cultural infrastructure is in place, workplaces 
are in much better shape to offer employees more work-from-home days post-pandemic than they have in previous years.
