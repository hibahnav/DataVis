## Ed-Tech's Privacy Problem: A Closer Look

The pandemic further accelerated growth in the global EdTech market - a trend that is unlikely 
to slow down anytime soon as experts project the market will reach $285.2 billion by 2027 (Grand View Research). 

A growing market brings with it a growing number of data points on users - data that may enable us to identify how to
better serve the needs of both students and educators. However, when it comes to user privacy, many EdTech companies 
lack transparency and engage in worrying data collection practices that, though certainly helpful for bolstering company 
revenue, are unlikely to be of any benefit to either students or educators.
